# sqlalchemy-challenge
Using Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of your climate database.

In the "SurfsUp" folder, there are 2 files (app.py & climate_starter.ipynb) that analyse and explore the data stored in the "Resources" folder, presenting it in both a Jupyter Notebook and HTML format.

Both files look at the different weather stations in Hawaii and the weather measurements recorded from them including precipation and temperature observations.

climate_starter.ipynb covers more of the analysis of precipiation and temperature observations, with Precipitation (in mm) by Date being plotted in bar plot format, as well as a histogram of the frequency of Temperature occurrences.

app.py is used to generate a HTML file in which an API has been created for the dataset, with available routes listed on the index page and the routes having JSONified results for ease of use.
